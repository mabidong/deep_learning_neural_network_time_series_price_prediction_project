Use of deep learning neural network for time series price prediction problem:

Cryptocurrencies are the online form of payment for any kind of services or goods. Worldwide various companies have issued their own cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies today. As of today, 14th Nov 2021, 1 bitcoin is valued as $64,790.00 and currently occupies 66% of total market share of cryptocurrencies globally. With this market share, a million of people has invested on bitcoin. So, all those investors are always excited on the future price of the Bitcoin.

This project has beeb done for predicting the price of bitcoin cryptocurrency based on its past and current price trend using Deep Learning Approach. Because of its increasing value each day, many researchers have developed various research techniques based on either Machine learning or Deep learning such as Support Vector machines, Recurrent Neural Network, Long short-term memory network and so on. 


Its primarily focuses on predicting the price of bitcoin currency using the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). The performance metrics such as accuracy and efficiency of real bitcoin price and predicted prices has been also calculated using the recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) of two different architectures and Coevolutionary Neural Network (CNN). Also, the differentiation between the real price and predicted prices has been demonstrated graphically to give easy understanding.
